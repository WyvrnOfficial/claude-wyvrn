# write-plan

Decomposes a feature into a concrete, reviewable plan whose tasks an agentic worker can execute step-by-step. Each task is broken into atomic, checkboxed steps; each executable-code task follows red-green TDD; every task ends in a self-contained commit so the work is reversible at task granularity. The output is a plan file in `.claude-wyvrn-local/plans/` — the same directory `/flow` already retrieves for past-mistake context.

**Standalone by design.** This skill works on its own. If an approved spec exists in `.claude-wyvrn-local/specs/`, it is used as authoritative input. If no spec exists, the plan is drafted directly from the user's prompt + project context. `/brainstorm` is never required.

**Hand-off target.** The plan is written to be executed by `/subagent-dev` (subagent-driven-development) or `/flow`, task-by-task. The plan header names this explicitly so the executor knows how to run it.

## Execution principles

- Parallelize independent reads at Step 1.
- No implementation — plan only. The plan is the hand-off to `/flow` or `/subagent-dev`.
- Tasks must be atomic and independently verifiable. Steps within a task must each be a single ~2–5 minute action.
- Every task ends in a commit. No "implement everything, then test, then one big commit".
- Spec-optional: a matching spec sharpens scope, but its absence does not block planning.

## Preconditions

If `~/.claude-wyvrn/VERSION` missing → halt: `Wyvrn harness not installed. Run claude-wyvrn install.`

## Trigger

- Slash: `/write-plan <feature>`
- Natural: "write a plan for", "plan this out", "break this into tasks", "what are the steps to"

## Behavior

### Step 1 — Load context (parallel batch)

Read in one parallel batch:

- `.claude-wyvrn-local/PROJECT.md` if present, else `README.md` if present (skip silently if neither exists)
- `.claude-wyvrn-local/ARCHITECTURE.md` if present (skip silently if missing)
- `.claude-wyvrn-local/specs/` — list files and read any whose slug matches the feature topic (top 1–2). A matching approved spec, when present, is treated as authoritative for scope and acceptance criteria. **If no spec is found, proceed without one — do not prompt the user to brainstorm.**
- Relevant stack conventions if the target stack is known.

While loading, capture the facts the plan header needs: the **tech stack**, the **build command**, and the **test command** (e.g. how a single test is built and run). If the project has no unit-test harness for the area being touched, note that — it changes how Step 3 writes the test steps.

The user's prompt is always the primary input. A spec sharpens the prompt; its absence is not a blocker.

### Step 2 — Clarify scope (if needed)

Ask only what cannot be inferred from the prompt + loaded context:

- **Feature boundary** — what is in scope, what is explicitly out.
- **Order constraints** — any tasks that must precede others beyond what's obvious.
- **Acceptance signal** — how the user will know the feature works (skip if a spec already defines this).

Batch into one AskUserQuestion call. Skip entirely if scope is clear from prompt + context. Do not ask "should we brainstorm first" — that is not this skill's concern.

### Step 3 — Draft the plan

Build the plan in two layers: a **header block** that orients the executor, then a sequence of **tasks**, each decomposed into **checkbox steps**.

#### 3a — Header block

Compose, in order:

- **Goal** — one paragraph: the observable change once the whole plan lands.
- **Architecture** — the approach in 2–4 sentences: the shape of the solution and the key design decision(s) it commits to (mirror the spec if one exists).
- **Tech Stack** — language/standard, build system, test framework, and the exact build + single-test commands.
- **Spec** — path to the spec file, or omit the line entirely if there is none.
- **Executor directive** — a fixed blockquote line, placed as the plan's second line, copied verbatim (no per-plan variation):
  `> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use `/subagent-dev` (subagent-driven-development, recommended) or `/flow` to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.`
- **File Structure table** — one row per file the plan touches: `File | Responsibility | Change`. This is the at-a-glance map.
- **Testing note** — state the test strategy and any precedent it follows. If part of the work cannot be unit-tested (no loopback harness, wire-format/IPC, visual rendering, etc.), say so here and say how those tasks are verified instead (build + runtime observation). This is where universal.md §1.6 ("docs/config without logic need no test") is reconciled with the codebase's real test surface — do not invent a test harness the project lacks.

#### 3b — Tasks and steps

Break the feature into atomic tasks (aim for 2–5; see ordering rules below). For each task:

- **Heading:** `### Task N: <imperative title>`
- **Files:** every path the task touches, each tagged `Modify:` / `Create:` / `Test:`. No globs.
- **Steps:** an ordered list of `- [ ]` checkbox steps, each a single ~2–5 minute action with a bolded label (`**Step 1: <action>**`). Give the exact code/edit inline — no placeholders, no "etc.". A step that changes a function gives the signature and the precise logic.

**TDD step pattern — required for any task that changes executable code:**

1. `**Step 1: Write the failing test**` — the exact test code and where it goes (file + anchor), plus how it is registered/discovered.
2. `**Step 2: Run the test to verify it fails**` — the exact run command and the expected failure (compile error or assertion), so the worker confirms red for the right reason.
3. One or more implementation steps — the minimal change to make it pass.
4. `**Step: Run the test to verify it passes**` — the run command and expected PASS.
5. `**Step: Commit**` — see commit step below.

**Non-TDD tasks** (docs, config without logic, or code whose area genuinely has no test harness per the Testing note): replace steps 1–4 with the implementation steps followed by a **build/verify step** — the exact build command plus a concrete observable check (a grep that must match, a log line that must/must not appear, a runtime behavior to eyeball). Never a bare "it should work".

**Commit step — required as the last step of every task:**

```` markdown
- [ ] **Step N: Commit**

```bash
git add <only the files this task touched>
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <subject>"
```
````

`git add` lists the exact files — never `git add -A`. The message follows `gitflow.md` §3 (`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`, imperative, lowercase, ≤72 chars).

**Ordering rules:**

- Earlier tasks must not depend on code from later tasks.
- Infrastructure tasks (types, interfaces, data models, wire formats) before logic tasks.
- Logic tasks before integration tasks.
- Integration tasks before UI/consumer tasks.

Aim for 2–5 tasks per plan, each with roughly 3–8 steps. If a feature genuinely requires more tasks, split into two plan files (Part 1 / Part 2).

#### 3c — Closing sections

Both sections are **always present**. When nothing applies, write the explicit-empty form rather than omitting the section — that forces an active confirmation instead of a silent gap.

**Out of scope.** State what the plan deliberately excludes.

- **Cross-boundary contract** — when any work lands in another repo, another team, or a follow-up plan, name the exact contract the other side must honor: message type names **and their numeric values**, version bumps, struct/API shapes, ordering/compositing semantics, handshake requirements. Make it precise enough to build against without further questions.
- When nothing applies: `None — fully self-contained (single repo, no downstream contract).`

Worked example (condensed from a real cross-repo plan):

> The emulator (separate repo) must add a `DeviceCanvasUpdated` (msg type 10) handler that, keyed by device identity, stores the W×H RGBA grid and composites locally: clear → space → device-on-top (replace-if-lit). The protocol handshake must accept v4. This plan delivers only the publisher half.

**Self-Review notes.** Four checks (see the Step 3d gate — these are completed *before* review, not after):

1. **Spec coverage** — every spec requirement (or, spec-less, every stated goal/AC) mapped to the task(s) that deliver it, each ticked ✓.
2. **Placeholder scan** — confirm no `TBD`/`TODO`/"similar to"/"handle edge cases"/"etc." anywhere; every step carries the full exact change (enforces universal.md §1.2).
3. **Type/name consistency** — list every new symbol (function, type, enum value + its number, field, message name); confirm each is spelled identically in every task it appears in.
4. **Ordering invariants** — call out any sequencing that must hold (init-before-use, validity-before-consume, an interface + its override landing in the same task to keep the tree compiling).

Worked example:

> - **Spec coverage:** clear→space→device ordering → Tasks 2/4/3 ✓; replace-if-lit blend → Task 1 + truth-table test ✓; persistent device layer → Task 2 ✓.
> - **Placeholder scan:** no TBD/TODO/"similar to" — every code step shows full code ✓.
> - **Type consistency:** `Overrides(const CColor&)`, `CompositeOver(const CColor&, const CColor&)`, `CompositeDeviceLayer()` (void), `m_DeviceLayer` (CCanvas) — spelled identically in every task ✓.
> - **Ordering invariants:** `m_DeviceLayer` sized before composite; space write composites onto the cleared base, not over it ✓.

#### 3d — Self-Review gate (mandatory, before Step 4)

Run the four Self-Review checks against the drafted plan **before** emitting it for review. If any check fails — an unmapped requirement, a placeholder, an inconsistent symbol, an unstated ordering dependency — fix the plan first. Never emit a plan for approval with an unfilled or failing Self-Review.

### Step 4 — Review

Emit the full plan (header + tasks + closing sections, **including the completed Self-Review**) as a chat message. AskUserQuestion header `Plan`, options `[Save plan, Refine, Abort]`.

- `Save plan` → Step 5.
- `Refine` (or "Other" + text) → incorporate feedback, re-run the Step 3d gate, re-emit, repeat Step 4.
- `Abort` → halt. Do not write any file.

### Step 5 — Write plan file

Write `.claude-wyvrn-local/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-plan.md` where `<slug>` is a lowercase-hyphenated summary of the feature (≤5 words). Create `plans/` if missing (should already exist from any prior `/flow` run).

File format (the outer fence is four backticks only so the inner ```bash``` / language fences render literally — do not copy the four-backtick fence into the plan):

```` markdown
# <Feature title> — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use `/subagent-dev` (subagent-driven-development, recommended) or `/flow` to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** <one paragraph — the observable change once the plan lands>

**Architecture:** <2–4 sentences — approach and key design decisions>

**Tech Stack:** <language/standard, build system, test framework; build + single-test commands>

**Spec:** <path to spec file>   ← omit this line entirely if there is no spec

## File Structure

| File | Responsibility | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `path/to/file` | <what it owns> | <what this plan changes in it> |

**Testing note:** <test strategy + precedent; which tasks are TDD vs build/verify and why>

---

### Task 1: <imperative title>

**Files:**
- Modify: `path/...`
- Create: `path/...`
- Test: `path/...`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

  <exact test code + where it goes + how it's registered>

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the test to verify it fails**

  Run: `<single-test command>`
  Expected: FAIL — <compile error or assertion that must fire>

- [ ] **Step 3: <implementation step>**

  <exact change>

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test to verify it passes**

  Run: `<single-test command>`
  Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add path/... path/...
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <subject>"
```

### Task 2: <title>

...

## Out of scope

<one line: what this plan excludes. When work lands in another repo/team/follow-up,
name the contract that side must honor — message types + numeric values, version bumps,
struct/API shapes, ordering semantics. When nothing applies:
"None — fully self-contained (single repo, no downstream contract).">

## Self-Review notes

- **Spec coverage:** <each spec requirement / goal → the task(s) that deliver it, ✓>
- **Placeholder scan:** <confirm no TBD/TODO/"similar to"/"etc." — every step shows full code ✓>
- **Type/name consistency:** <list each new symbol (incl. enum value + number); spelled identically everywhere ✓>
- **Ordering invariants:** <sequencing that must hold — init-before-use, validity-before-consume, ... ✓>
````

Emit:

```
Plan written: .claude-wyvrn-local/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-plan.md

Tasks: N   Steps: M
Next: /subagent-dev <plan-file> to execute with subagents, or /flow referencing each task.
```

## Stop conditions

- User aborts at any step → halt, no file written.
- Feature is too vague to decompose → ask one round of clarifying questions in Step 2. If still vague after clarification, halt and tell the user the prompt is too ambiguous to plan against (do not produce a vague plan, but do not require any specific upstream skill either).

## Constraints

- Do NOT produce implementation code in the working tree. The plan *contains* exact code to write, but this skill does not apply it.
- Do NOT modify source files, configs, or anything outside `.claude-wyvrn-local/plans/`.
- Do NOT modify `~/.claude-wyvrn/`.
- Do NOT invent a test harness the project does not have — honor the Testing note from Step 3a.
- All confirmations via `AskUserQuestion`.
